## STL Skatespots

This is a web application with the goal of helping people in the St. Louis area share and discover places to skateboard. The majority of skate spots are shared through word of mouth, rarely with a precise location. Many spots can be hidden behind a building, or down an alley, making exact location or a short description about where it is valuable. Very much still a work in progress but ultimate goal is to deploy.
